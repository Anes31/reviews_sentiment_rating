    "#text = '''we went here on a saturday afternoon and this place was incredibly empty.  they had brunch specials going on, including $2 bloody mary's and mimosas, but we were more in the mood for lunch.  except for the bloody mary, i had to try one.  it came out in a high-ball-sized glass.  boo!  but it was really tasty. yay!  the hubby remembered a sign outside the restaurant a few weeks back that said they had arrogant bastard, and he got a 22 oz bottle for $4.75.  hey, that's not fair!!next up: the wings.  we were a bit hesitant to order them when the waitress informed us that they are \"seasoned\" but not sauced, so they can't be ordered hot.  we did ask for them crispy though, and the waitress even asked the cooks to throw them back in for a few minutes when they came out not visibly crispy.  these non-traditional wings were actually pretty damn good.  the seasoning was a little spicy and salty with just a hint of sweet.  if i were in the mood for the tang and kick of frank's hot sauce, these wouldn't cut it, but otherwise they were good enough to go back again for.my entree was the tilapia salad, and i was a bit disappointed.  the fish was a bit dry and uninspired. and the greens underneath were overdressed and wilted.  i ate the greens around the fish and picked out the almonds and mandarin oranges, but i had to leave the mush hiding underneath the fish.it wasn't bad enough to say i wouldn't go back, but i won't be anxiously awaiting my next trip.'''\n",
